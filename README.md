## Welcome to the README!

This is my GitHub pages website.

It is still very much a WIP.

Goals:

- Host and publish a website through GitHub:
  - Homepage
  - About, Resume, Blog pages
  - RSS feed
<br>
- Familiarize myself with Git and Jekyll layout
- Write posts about learnings from class (math/statistics/cs)
- Serve as a history of my interests
