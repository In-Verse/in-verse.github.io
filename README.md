## Welcome to the README!

This is my GitHub pages website. 

It is still very much a WIP that was started in thanks to Jonathan McGlone's [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).

Goals:

- Write HTML and CSS (later incorporate JavaScript)
- Host and publish a website through GitHub:
  - Homepage
  - About, Resume, Blog pages
  - RSS feed
<br>
- Familiarize myself with Git and Jekyll layout
- Write posts about learnings from class (math/statistics/computer science)
- Serve as a history of my interests
