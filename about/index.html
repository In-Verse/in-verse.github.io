	<h1>About</h1>
		<p>My name is Rosemary. I'm a former biology student turned onto the joys of code.</p>
		<p>After high school, I went to Chatham College for Women to study biology. However, in 2014, my college went into co-educational transition and reform for fear of bankruptcy. But, no fear! 
		Alas, I went in search of a school with support for both my major (math/CS) and stable undergraduate teaching. 
		<b>I'm commencing study at The Evergreen State College for computer science!</b></p>
