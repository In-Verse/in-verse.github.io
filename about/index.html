	<h1>About</h1>
		<h4><b>The Short</b></h4>
		<p>Rosemary Davies is a former biology student turned onto the joys of code. Instead of the microscope, she is looking at her computer screen trying to find the missing parentheses.

		<h4><b>The Long</b></h4>
			<p>I was born in Lexington, Kentucky as the daughter of a New Zealand dairy farmer and a second generation Chinese American. Soon after, a tornado struck and shook up my familyâ€™s life. I moved to California with my mother and sister to live with my grandparents on their chestnut orchard. There, I was surrounded by the vast expanse of countryside. I continued to grow, with many books and many interesting conversations around the dinner table.   
<br></p>
	<p>Many years later, I went to Chatham College for Women in Pittsburgh, PA intending to study biology. However, in 2014, my college went into transition and reform. And so, I took some time off to find another journey.
