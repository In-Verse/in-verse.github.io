	<h1>About</h1>
		<p>My name is Rosemary. I'm a former biology student turned onto the joys of code.</p>
		<p>After high school, I went to Chatham College for Women to study biology. However, in 2014, my college went into co-educational transition and reform for fear of bankruptcy. But, no fear! 
		<br> Alas, I went in search of a school with support for both my major (math/CS) and stable undergraduate teaching.<br> 
		<strong>I'm commencing study at The Evergreen State College for computer science!</strong></p>
		<br>
		<p><b>Currently working on...</b> my fear of Taylor Series! </p>
		<p><b>Learning</b> Java<b> on my preferred text editor...</b> Atom.</p>
		<p><b>Wasting time with playing </b>Braid<b> to TAS levels of perfections</b>
		and <b>listening to</b> Simon and Garfunkel.</p>
		<p><b>If You'll Pardon the Pun</b>: Git thee to a repository!</p>
		<br>
			<p>My childhood dreams:</p>

				<li>Work with books at The Internet Archive</li>
				<li>Do a 3-month rotation at the US Antarctic station, McMurdo</li>
