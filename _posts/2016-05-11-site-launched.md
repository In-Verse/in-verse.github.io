Hello world!

This is Rosemary who has finally got around to putting this site together. I'm trying to move away from Content Management Systems like WordPress and Tumblr; although I love them dearly, I'm looking forward to taking more control of my site. This website is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with static (not dynamic) pages. 

Already great things are (1) the ease of use, (2) integration of Git, and (3) the flexibility!

I'm still getting used to writing in Markdown. I've been using this ["cheat sheet"](http://packetlife.net/media/library/16/Markdown.pdf)
