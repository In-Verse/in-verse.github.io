<p>This exercise is about creating a SSH key, and then using the web shell to login with it.</p>

<p>Why use SSH keys? You can be authenticated by the server <strong>without</strong> having to send your password over a network. You are invulnerable to <strong>brute force</strong>. SSH keys are created in pairs, one is the private key and the other is the public key. You can share the public key with the server, but make sure the private key is kept for your eyes only (usu. ~/.ssh). </p>

<p>First, you need to use ssh-keygen to create a unique SSH key for yourself. Use <em>-t</em> for a type of RSA key and <em>-C</em> for a comment. If not already setup, this should setup a .ssh directory that has something like: id_rsa , id_rsa.pub</p>

<p>Add the id_rsa.pub to your authorized_keys in the PICO CTF web shell. </p>

<p>Now you can login with username@shell2017.picoctf.com </p>

<p>First change directory. But when we get there and try to cat <em>flag</em> - we can’t! Permission denied. </p>

<p>Let’s look at the hex2raw executable. Once we do it, it gives us the flag in raw: v\h3- </p>

<p>How do we get the raw Ascii back to hex? Just pipe it to XXD!</p>

<p>This is least significant bit steganography! We can feed it into MatLab </p>

<h4 id="just-keyp-trying">Just Keyp Trying</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s an interesting capture of some data. But what exactly is this data? Take a look: <a href="https://webshell2017.picoctf.com/static/c1ac3c09e54ebd58ec61853a820d6322/data.pcap">data.pcap</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Take a look at it in Notepad! It’s… erm… undecipherable confusing data squiggles? Anyway, it’s a .pcap file, so let’s look in WireShark. </p>

<p>The info column says “URB_INTERRUPT in”, while the protocol column says “USB”. </p>

<p>These packets seem to be USB packets with USBPcap headers. Not only do the packets differ in time - but, in a value called Leftover Capture Data, aka. usb.capdata. An example is “00 00 15 00 00 00 00 00”</p>

<p>Why is it in that format? Well, a keyboard sends press-key and release-key information to the OS, which interprets it based on the application. The usual format is in a byte array like: [modifier, reserved, key1, key2, key3, key4, key6, key 7]. For instance, ‘a’ is [0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]. A capitol ‘A’ would have a ‘Left Shift’ modifier so it’d be:  [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]</p>

<p>We want the third byte, and we’re going to reference the <a>usage tables</a> for key codes on a USB keyboard. The usage ID is the third field for key1. </p>

<p>Use tshark to get the byte array <code>tshark -r data.pcap -T fields -e usb.capdata | cut -d ':' -f 3</code>. Then feed that into python with a dictionary for a-z, numbers and their usage ids. I got <strong>flag{pr355_0nwards_3A10134E}</strong></p>

<p>Note: Do not worry about case sensitivity</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We recovered some <a href="https://webshell2017.picoctf.com/static/356968c2d973cde33a5135ae3fc94c22/RSA.txt">data</a>. It was labeled as RSA, but what in the world are “dq” and “dp”? Can you decrypt the ciphertext for us?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The data file has: c, p, q, dp, dq</p>

<p>It seems like this might be related to an equation. A quick search leads us to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29#Using_the_Chinese_remainder_algorithm">Chinese remainder algorithm</a> where p and q are primes for the key generation, and dp and dq are (1/e)(mod (p-1)( and (1/e)(mod (q-1)) respectively. </p>

<p>Then, there’s qInv = (1/q) mod (p)</p>

<ul>
<li>p and q are primes for key generation</li>
<li>dp = (1/e) mod (p-1)</li>
<li>dq = (1/e) mod (q -1)</li>
<li>Qinv = 1/q mod p (multiplicative inverse - not regular div)</li>
<li>m1 = pow(c,dp,p)</li>
<li>m2 = pow(c, dq, q) 7-1) h = Qinv(m1 - m2) mod p ; if m1 &lt; m2 7-2) h = Qinv * (m1 + q/p)</li>
<li>m = m2 + hq</li>
</ul>

We can feed this into python. A trick is to use the built-in pow function because you can supply a mod. This reduces the program time, instead of using mod, %, after computing the power.

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-no-highlight">foo:

     else:

         g, y, x = egcd(b % a, a)
         return (g, x - (b // a) * y, y)

def modinv(a, m):
     g, x, y = egcd(a, m)
     if g != 1:
         raise Exception('modular inverse does not exist')
     else:
         return x % m

# We have c,p,q, dp, dq

# m = m2 + hq
m = m2 + h * q
print(m)</code></pre>

<p>Don't forget to change the decoded hex into Ascii to read the flag!</p>

<h4 id="a-thing-called-the-stack">A Thing Called the Stack</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>A friend was stacking dinner plates, and handed you <a href="https://webshell2017.picoctf.com/static/d1ef36f6a6a553891a9552d65c8c422c/assembly.s">this</a>, saying something about a “stack”. Can you find the difference between the value of esp at the end of the code, and the location of the saved return address? Assume a 32 bit system. Submit the answer as a hexidecimal number, with no extraneous 0s. For example, the decimal number 2015 would be submitted as 0x7df, not 0x000007df</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We want the difference (bytes) between the value of the register esp at the return address of the current frame and at the end of the code. </p>

<p>esp and ebp are both registers. ebp points to the base of the current frame (just below the return address of the current function frame), and esp points to the top of the stack.</p>

<p>Things of note: </p>

<ul>
<li>Stack grows from <em>higher</em> addresses to <em>lower</em> addresses</li>
<li>The format of assembly code is <code>operation arg</code> or <code>operation arg1,arg2</code></li>
<li>For a 32 bit system, each value on the stack takes <em>4 bytes</em></li>
<li>The difference between the esp (instruction pointer) and ebp (base pointer) is the function stack frame</li>
<li>The x86 assembly language here is AT&amp;T Synatx</li>
</ul>

<p>The assembly code is: </p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-no-highlight">foo:
    pushl %ebp
    mov %esp, %ebp
    pushl %edi
    pushl %esi
    pushl %ebx
    sub $0x48, %esp
    movl $0x1, (%esp)
    movl $0x2, 0x4(%esp)
    movl $0x3, 0x8(%esp)
    movl $0x4, 0xc(%esp)</code></pre>

<p>Let’s walk through this one step at a time.  <br>
1. Foo function is called, the return address is pushed on top of the stack. </p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Stack</th>
  <th align="center"></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
  <td>return address</td>
  <td align="center"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>saved ebp</td>
  <td align="center">&lt;= %esp</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>


<p>2. ebp register is pushed onto the stack.</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3">esp = (1 push)* (4 bytes/push) = 0x04 bytes</script> <br>
3. current value of esp is assigned to ebp <br>
4. push DWORD contents of edi to address pointed by esp.  <br>
5. push DWORD contents of esi to address pointed by esp.  <br>
6. push DWORD contents of ebx to address pointed by esp. </p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-4">esp = 0x04 + (3 pushes)* (4 bytes/push) = 0x10 bytes</script></p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Stack</th>
  <th align="center"></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
  <td>return address</td>
  <td align="center"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>saved ebp</td>
  <td align="center"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>%edi</td>
  <td align="center"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>%esi</td>
  <td align="center"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>%ebx</td>
  <td align="center">&lt;= %esp</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>


<p>7. subtract esp by 0x48  <br>
    * Note: stack grows to lower addresses; subtraction moves esp farther away from ebp</p>

<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-5">esp = 0x10 + 0x48 = 0x58 bytes</script> <br>
8. place value of 0x1 into the first DWORD slot of array (0,esp) <br>
9. place value of 0x2 into the second DWORD slot of array (4,esp) <br>
10. place value of 0x3 into the third DWORD slot of array (8,esp) <br>
11. place value of 0x4 into the fouth DWORD slot of array (12,esp)</p>

<p>The difference between of esp is <strong>0x58</strong>, which is the flag!</p>

<p>The final stack:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Stack</th>
  <th></th>
  <th align="center"></th>
  <th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
  <td>ebp:</td>
  <td></td>
  <td align="center"></td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td>ebp-4</td>
  <td align="center">%ebp</td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td>ebp-8</td>
  <td align="center">%edi</td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td>ebp-12</td>
  <td align="center">%esi</td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td>ebp-16</td>
  <td align="center">%ebx</td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td>ebp-88</td>
  <td align="center">0x1</td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td>ebp-92</td>
  <td align="center">0x2</td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>

  <td>ebp-96</td>
  <td align="center">0x3</td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td>ebp-100</td>
  <td align="center">0x4</td>
  <td>&lt;= %esp</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>


<ul>
<li>Where is the return address saved on the stack?</li>
</ul>

<p>It is stored by the instruction base pointer, ebp, which holds the current stack frame. </p>

<ul>
<li>Which commands actually affect the stack?</li>
</ul>

<p>Commands that modify like <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code>. However, the final <code>mov</code> commands do not affect the stack because they do not actually modify the esp register. The <code>mov</code> commands are instead writing values to the place that the register esp is pointing to on the stack. We know this because of the surrounding parentheses, ie. <code>movl $0x3, 0x8(%esp)</code>.   </p>

  <p>You found a <a href="https://webshell2017.picoctf.com/static/6be99f460cce6e9e3359ba0544ed15fe/assembly.s">text file</a> with some really low level code. Some value at the beginning has been X’ed out. Can you figure out what should be there, to make main return the value 0x1? Submit the answer as a hexidecimal number, with no extraneous 0s. For example, the decimal number 2015 would be submitted as 0x7df, not 0x000007df</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s look through the code. </p>


<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-no-highlight">.global main

main:
    mov $XXXXXXX, %eax
    mov $0, %ebx
    mov $0x6, %ecx
loop:
    test %eax, %eax
    jz fin
    add %ecx, %ebx
    dec %eax
    jmp loop
fin:
    cmp $0x86a0, %ebx
    je good
    mov $0, %eax
    jmp end
good:
    mov $1, %eax
end:
    ret</code></pre>

<p>We want to return 0x1, and we find that in the good subroutine. Okay, so the big question is - <em>how do we get to good?</em></p>

<p>Let’s work backwords.</p>

<p>To get to <em>good</em>, we need to get to <em>fin</em>. We have a operation <code>cmp $0x86a0, %ebx</code> where we need ebx to equal 0x86a0 or 34464. </p>

<p>Okay, <em>how do we get to fin</em>?</p>

<p>To get to <em>fin</em>, we need eax to equal 0 in the loop subroutine. If eax is not 0, then the loop will repeat with the following.</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-no-highlight">    add %ecx, %ebx
    dec %eax
    jmp loop</code></pre>

<p>The register ecx is added with what’s in the register ebx. Then the register eax is decremented. It continues until eax is zero (hence, the subroutine being named a loop!)</p>

<p><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6">ebx += (eax * ecx)</script></p>

<p>If we note at the beginning of the main subroutine, ebx is initialized to 0 and ecx is initialized to 6. We want ebx, however, to evaluate to 34464 for the fin subroutine.</p>

<p><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7">34464+= (eax * 6)</script></p>

<p>We divide by 6 to get 5744, which is 0x1670 in hex.  This is the starting value that eax is initialized to. <strong>0x1670 is our flag.</strong></p>

<p>This is kind of suspicious in the shells.c. The function win will read the flag! </p>

<p>Perhaps we can play with the function <code>win</code>. We can’t just pipe in shellcode because.. now, unfortunately, the program only wants 10 bytes! </p>

<p>First, let’s get the address of the function <code>win</code> with gdb.</p>

<p>Awesome! So the memory location we want is 0x8048540. Now, there are two options. You can either jump to it or push it to the instruction pointer, and return. I’ve decided to push to the address. </p>

<p>The strtol is a function that interprets an integer value in a byte string. </p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-no-highlight">long int strtol(const char *str, char **endptr, int base)</code></pre>

<p>Strtol is what takes our input, which is originally a 32-bit integer.  Perhaps we can overflow it with the register that has the win function in the guess_num.c code. </p>

<p>Important things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li>We want val to point to the <code>win</code> address</li>
<li>val gets checked for overflow</li>
<li>There is a 4 bitwise shift to the right</li>
</ul>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-no-highlight">scanf("%32s",buf);
val=strtol(buf,NULL,10);
val &gt;&gt;=4;</code></pre>

<p>strtol checks for overflow, but it <em>does</em> allow negative numbers. </p>

<p>Our address for <code>win</code> is 0x804852b . In decimal, this is: 134513963. In binary, this is: </p>

<p>1000 0000 0100 1000 0101 0010 1011</p>

<p>We shift <code>win</code> to the left by 4 places. </p>

<p>1000 0000 0100 1000 0101 0010 1011 0000</p>

<p>This is now 2152223408 in decimal. It is greater than a 32 bit integer whose max value is 2147483647. That said, we can <em>use the information that 2152223408 will overflow</em>. We just need to figure out what that number is.</p>

<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-8">2152223408 - (2^{31} -1) = 4739761
\\ -(2^{31})+4739761 = -2142743887</script></p>

<p>So, we need to input the number -2142743887</p>

<p>The hint tells us that this is a beginning format string attack. </p>

<p>A format string is usually the first argument to a printf function. They use format specifiers to <em>indicate</em> how it should be formatted. </p>

<ul>
<li>Position in string indicates argument</li>
<li>Specifier like %s, %f, %d indicate type</li>
<li>printf takes variable number of arguments</li>
<li>printf can access memory outside of where the stack frame “ends”</li>
</ul>

<p>It is sometimes called or compared to a buffer overflow because (1) the stack data structure is similar to a buffer and (2) bogus input allows one to access outside a  stack frame. Here are some examples.</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-no-highlight">\\ Normal usage
printf("My name is %s and I am %d", name, age);
\\ Where it goes wrong
printf("100% dood"); \\ Prints stack entry 4 bytes above %eip
printf("%s"); \\ Prints bytes pointed to by that stack entry
printf("100% no") \\ Writes 3 to address pointed to by stack entry</code></pre>

<p>When we look at the secret.c code, there’s two things to note. First, there’s a call to /dev/urandom, which generates a random value each instance for the variable secret. This is the variable that is compared to our input to determine if we can cat the flag. Last but not least, we can see that <code>printf</code> is used. This is <strong>important</strong> because the <code>printf(buffer)</code> in the code <em>does not check for type</em>. This means that we can netcat in and use format strings like <code>%x</code> to acess values.</p>

<p>So, let’s do it! Let’s read from the stack!</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-no-highlight">nc shell2017.picoctf.com 5320
&gt; %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x</code></pre>

<p>I get this on the first try:</p>

<p>40 f7fc7c20 8048792 1 ffffdd34 76593d94 3 f7fc73c4 ffffdca0 0 f7e37a63    </p>

<p>I get this on the second try:</p>

<p>40 f7fc7c20 8048792 1 ffffdd34 f6bc530 3 f7fc73c4 ffffdca0 0 f7e37a63    </p>

<p>By comparing the two, we know that the 5th argument or result from %x is the address that is holding the variable secret.</p>

<p>On my last try: </p>

<p>40 f7fc7c20 8048792 1 ffffdd34 516ff4c6 3 f7fc73c4 ffffdca0 0 f7e37a63    </p>

<p>Great! I give the secret, 516ff4c6 , and obtain the flag <strong>7662bb6d94ae9ab986288a5353e7b86a</strong>                      </p>

<p>I’m up for flag making! The user input is echoed by the system</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-no-highlight">char commandBase[] = "/bin/echo \"%s\"\n";
...
snprintf(command,commandLen,commandBase,flag);
system(command)</code></pre>

<p>Input is not escaped so let’s use this vulnerability. We can use the quotation marks to make it seem like a string, but with the semicolon to execute our command. Normally, you use semicolons in bash programming to have multiple commands on a line. For instance, <code>ls . ; cd ..</code> would list your current directory and then change your directory to the parent. </p>

<p>A hash chain is a successive application of a hash. For instance, let H be the hash function and x as the secret string. A server might store the hash1000(x). When the user authenticates with the server, they give it hash999(x). The server then takes the hash of hash999(x) to get back a value, H(hash999(x)) which it checks with hash1000(x).</p>

<p>There are two steps for the server:</p>

<ol>
<li>Check if H(hash999(x)) equal hash1000(x)</li>
<li>If it does, replace hash1000(x) with hash999(x)</li>
</ol>

<p>When we netcat into the application, we are greeted by this.</p>

r/f?

This flag only for user 2597                                                           
Please authenticate as user 2597

Hello user 2597! Here's the flag: 96630f954dd403c7882666b5443e4678 </code></pre>

<p>The flag is <strong>96630f954dd403c7882666b5443e4678</strong>.</p>

<p>There are a couple downsides to our python code. For example, it’s much more likely that the hash chain will be <em>longer</em> than 100. Additionally, we could have looped back our python code into the program by reading in the system output of the hash. </p>

  <p>You stumbled upon a group <a href="https://webshell2017.picoctf.com/static/02935824ea6d6f63e19cb744bb1aea60/clue.txt">Message</a>. Can you figure out what they were sending? The string sent is ascii encoded as a hex number (submit the ascii string as the flag)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have a hint:     The same message, with a small exponent, is being encrypted with several different n values</p>

<p>When we look at the values in the message, we see assignment of variables e,c1,n1,c2,n2,c3,n3</p>

<p>A quick search shows me that this is <a>RSA with a low secret exponent</a>. In particular, this is Hastad’s broadcast attack. We have 3 different ciphertexts and 3 different public keys. Because n1, n2, and n3 are relatively prime, then we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to calculate the third root.</p>

<p>Good news is that we don’t have to recreate the wheel because someone already made a <a href="https://github.com/JulesDT/RSA-Hastad">python tool</a></p>
