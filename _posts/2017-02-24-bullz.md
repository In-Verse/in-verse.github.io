There's a town my cousin has to <i>always</i> pass through to get from Tauranga to Wellington for university. It's the town of Bulls. I was lucky enough to visit over the summer.
<br> <br>
Bulls is a town in the North Island's lower half. It’s named after James Bull, 
founder and owner of the first general store. It was originally called Bull Town, 
then Clifton, then named Bulls due to insistence of Sir William Fox, New Zealand’s 
second Premier.
<br> <br>
It might be a small town of a couple thousand, but they really milk the puns here. Even the toilets
are called "Relieve-a-Bull" and the trash cans are called "Relieve-a-Bull"!
<br>
<br>
<strong> It's the only place you can get milk from bulls! </strong>
