Charles Dodgson wrote this poem. He is better known as Lewis Carroll for writing <em>Alice and Wonderland</em> and <em>Through the Looking Glass</em>. Dodgson was also a mathematician who pioneered how to find the determinant of a square matrix; essentially, whether a solution to a system of linear equations exist. 
Notice that this poem fits in a 6x6 table. Itâ€™s a square. Also, notice that the poem can be read both horizontally (through the rows) and vertically (through the columns). For example, see the <strong>bolded text</strong> above. 

Personally, this is fascinating if you use linear algebra to consider the poem as a matrix. So, then you can see that a12 = a21; in this case, "often" = "often"
When the columns and the rows of a matrix are interchanged, then we get the transpose of that matrix. In this case, A= AT
By a further set of proofs (A-1AT = I)  we can see that our matrix A is invertible, and thus because of logical equivalence, we can know much more too; Yes, linear algebra deals with numbers (integers, floats). However, Dodgson shows that you can also look at words (strings)!
